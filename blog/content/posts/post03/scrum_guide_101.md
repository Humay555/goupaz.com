Regardless of whether you are a student, a working professional, or simply a lifelong learner, if you are interested in learning about Scrum, and don’t know where to start, you may find the short guide listed below with links to essential resources helpful:

1. Read the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/). One of the principles of “Agile Manifesto” is making sure team reflects on their effectiveness and adjusts it at regular intervals. Scrum applies this principle with the use of Sprint Retrospective.

2.  Watch this [introduction to Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/introduction-scrum) and acquaint yourself further with the terms mentioned in the video by reading the 2020 version of the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

3. Review the contents of [this learning path](https://www.scrum.org/pathway/scrum-master/) for Scrum Masters that offers information on key focus areas that are grouped under their respective Professional Scrum Competencies, which include the following: “Understanding and Applying Scrum” and “Managing Products with Agility”

4.  Check your understanding of the key concepts mentioned above by trying out this [free test](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open) from Scrum.org that was created for Professional Scrum Master I certification. This test will assess you against the “Scrum Guide” and the “Professional Scrum Competencies.”

I picked these resources not only according to frequency with which they are referred to in the industry by Scrum practitioners, but also thanks to the clear and concise language used. The literature shared also provides multiple real-world examples and free tests to secure your understanding

I have also referred to these resources many times during my own learning process and I continue to come back to them to this day.

If you would like some guidance on what to read next to deepen your knowledge on Scrum, or have any questions following from the reading mentioned above, please let me know!
