## Abstract

Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that data <sup>1</sup>. If you take a look at the <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrrer noopener">first-ever website</a><sup>2</sup>, you can come into conclusion that being a front-end developer used to be very easy in early stages of web development; you just had to write HTML, nothing more. After <a href="https://css-tricks.com/look-back-history-css/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introducing CSS</a><sup>3</sup> and <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-javascript/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JavaScript</a><sup>4</sup> the web started to be much more complicated.

After more than 20 years, HTML, CSS and JavaScript has evolved drastically and front-end development is now, so much more than just writing HTML and serving it statically. In today's world, a front-end developer needs to know how to develop accessible and performant web applications that requires a lot more knowledge than the technologies mentioned above. To be a front-end developer you need to add build tools, testing, JavaScript frameworks, performance optimization skills, web security, responsive design, web accessibility and other important stuff to your toolbox.

In this article we will talk about what you need to learn to be a front-end engineer that stands out from others. And of course, we'll share resources as well üòâ

üìù **Notice**: _Note that the headings are not sorted by any particular order. You can learn the mentioned concepts in any order you wish_

## Start with the basics

It doesn't matter weather you are front-end or a back-end engineer, you must have at least basic CS knowledge. If you have a degree in Computer Science or similar major, then you already are one step ahead of others. If you don't have a degree on CS or you are coming from completely different major, then I would recomment starting with <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS50: Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University</a> course on edX (it's free). After finishing that course, if you want a little deeper knowledge then you should enroll to <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines course by Princeton University</a> which is completely free on Coursera.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

Being part of the foundational knowledge, algorithms and data structures are very crucial to any kind of software engineer. If you already have knowledge about basic CS concepts then you must have heard of them before. As we are trying to be a front-end engineer, I recommend taking either <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms by Andrei Neagoie</a> or <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass by Colt Steele</a> on Udemy. Both of these courses has simple way of explaining the concepts and they use JavaScript to implement them. We love JavaScript, right? ü§ì If you are a book worm, then reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Data-Structures-Algorithms-Understanding/dp/1484239873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms by Sammie Bae</a> should be pretty much enough for you.
